# 📘 Langgraph Practice

A hands-on practice repository for learning and experimenting with **LangGraph**, a Python framework for building stateful, graph-based AI workflows and agents.

This repository contains practice scripts, experiments, and examples to understand how graph-based agent systems work using LangGraph and related LLM tooling.

---

## 🚀 Overview

LangGraph allows you to design AI systems as graphs made up of:

- Nodes (functions or logic steps)
- Edges (transitions between steps)
- Shared state (memory across steps)

This repo is focused on learning by doing — building small examples and testing different workflow patterns.
